What is a backdoor

A backdoor is a malware type that negates normal authentication procedures to access a system. As a result, remote access is granted to resources within an application, such as databases and file servers, giving perpetrators the ability to remotely issue system commands and update malware.

Backdoor installation is achieved by taking advantage of vulnerable components in a web application. Once installed, detection is difficult as files tend to be highly obfuscated.

Webserver backdoors are used for a number of malicious activities, including:

    Data theft
    Website defacing
    Server hijacking
    The launching of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks
    Infecting website visitors (watering hole attacks)
    Advanced persistent threat (APT) assaults
