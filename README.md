# attack
    Attack influence: An attack can have a causative influence if it aims to introduce vulnerabilities to be exploited at the classification phase by manipulating training data, or an exploratory influence if the attack aims to find and subsequently exploit vulnerabilities at classification phase. The attacker's capabilities might also be influenced by the presence of data manipulation constraints.[26]
    Security violation: An attack can cause an integrity violation if it aims to get malicious samples misclassified as legitimate, or it may cause an availability violation if the goal is to increase the wrong classification rate of legitimate samples, making the classifier unusable (e.g., a denial of service).
    Attack specificity: An attack can be targeted if specific samples are considered (e.g. the adversary aims to allow a specific intrusion or wants a given spam email to get past the filter), or indiscriminate.
